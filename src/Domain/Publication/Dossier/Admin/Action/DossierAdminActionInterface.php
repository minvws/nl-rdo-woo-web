 * Dossier admin actions are used on the /balie/admin/dossiers page to manually execute specific actions on dossiers.
 * For example triggering a re-index or regenerating download archives.
 *
 * Implementations should execute async for any action that isn't near-instant, as the user interface waits on the
 * result. A message is shown to the user that it may take some time to complete by default.
 * Usually this async execution can be easily implemented by just dispatching a command in the execute method.
