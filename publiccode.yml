    longDescription: |
      [Open.minvws.nl](https://open.minvws.nl/) is the Open Government Act
      (Woo; Wet open overheid) publication platform of the Ministry of Health,
      Welfare, and Sport in the  Netherlands (Ministerie van Volksgezondheid,
      Welzijn en Sport; short:  MinVWS). The aim of the OpenMinVWS platform is
      to streamline the process for  government officials to publish documents,
      while also improving  accessibility for journalists and the public to
      search through these  documents.


      The Woo consists of [17
      categories](https://open.overheid.nl/documenten/fd3aaf98-ad83-4a15-a526-b0511f283bad/file)
      of documents that need to be made public. At the moment the OpenMinVWS
      platform only supports the publication of category 14 (Woo-verzoeken,
      -besluiten en verstrekte informatie). Future  development will consist of
      adding more categories such as covenants and  year plans.
