# Definition of Done

This definition of Done is determined by the WOO team of iRealisatie. It is based on the template from iRealisatie quality coordination.

From now on we will use the following definition of Done for each story (issue) in the WOO project:

- Acceptance criteria are met
- QA has tested the feature locally
- QA signed of on the feature/story (in the ticket)
- Sonar Quality gate is passed
- A ticket is created for accepted technical depth (if any)

What we (at this point in the process) do not consider as part of the definition of Done:

- Accessibility testing
- E2E (Robot Framework) testing
- Technical documentation is finalized and up to date
- User documentation is finalized and up to date
- Release notes are finalized and up to date
